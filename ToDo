Roadmap:
- new planets (10?)
- random level creation
- show level
- different planet types (use uniform!)
  - "normal" planets
  - rotating planets (e.g. around another one => moons)
  - gas planets (gravity, but no collision)
- game itself
  - gravity (depends on the radius and mass, bigger gas planets are still lighter)
  - bullet has mass, speed and direction
  - showing the old trys in different colors
    - shaping the position of the rotating objects
- some planets with light source ("stars")
- ships as goal
- Menu
- Tutorial
  - every different planet step by step
- different bullet types?
- particles
- planets can have damage? (getting smaller?)
- highscore
  - more power => fewer points
  - more time used => fewer points
