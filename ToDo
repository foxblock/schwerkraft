Roadmap:
+ new planets (10?)
+ cool font
+ different planet types
  + "normal" planets
  + gas planets (gravity, but no collision)
  - rotating planets (e.g. around another one => moons)
+ random level creation
+ show level
- game itself
  - gravity (depends on the radius and mass, bigger gas planets are still lighter)
  - bullet has speed and direction
  - showing the old trys in different colors
    - shaping the position of the rotating objects
- ships as goal
- Intro
- Menu
- Tutorial
  - every different planet step by step
- different bullet types?
- KI (very important :-\)
- highscore
  - more power => fewer points
  - more time used => fewer points
